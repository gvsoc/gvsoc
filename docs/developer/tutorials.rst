0 - How to build a system from scratch
......................................

The goal of this tutorial is to build a simple system from scratch containing a core,
an interconnect and a memory.

The tutorial is located here: docs/developer/tutorials/0_how_to_build_a_system_from_scratch

The solution is under directory *solution*.

A simple runtime is available here: docs/developer/tutorials/utils

A makefile is available in the tutorial for compiling gvsoc, compiling the application to be
simulated, and running the simulation.

GVSOC can be compiled with *make gvsoc*, using this target: ::

    gvsoc:
        make -C ../../../.. TARGETS=my_system MODULES=$(CURDIR) build

It adds our local directory to the list of GVSOC modules so that it can find our system. This command is for now
failing as we need to write the script describing our system.

Compiling and running the application can be done with *make all run*. The run target also
adds our local directory to the list of target dirs so that it can find our system: ::

    run:
	    gvsoc --target-dir=$(CURDIR) --target=my_system --work-dir=$(BUILDDIR) --binary=$(BUILDDIR)/test run $(runner_args)

Now, in order to build a system scratch, we need to write a python generator of the system which
will assemble all the pieces together.

First we need to declare our system as a gapy target, which is the runner used to run GVSOC
simulation:

.. code-block:: python

    import gvsoc.runner

    GAPY_TARGET = True

    class Target(gvsoc.runner.Target):

        def __init__(self, parser, options):
            super(Target, self).__init__(parser, options,
                model=Rv64, description="RV64 virtual board")

The target should aways inherit from *gvsoc.runner.Target* and we should always put
*GAPY_TARGET = True* in the file so that gapy knows this is a valid target when we put it on
gapy command-line.

The *model* argument should give the class of our system that we will describe now.

First we will put a top component whose role is to provide a clock to the rest of the system.
The top component must always inherit from *gvsoc.systree.Component*, and contain and propagate all the
following options:

.. code-block:: python

    class Rv64(gvsoc.systree.Component):

        def __init__(self, parent, name, parser, options):
            super().__init__(parent, name, options=options)

Only the parser option does not need to be propagated but can be used to declare or get options
from the command-line.

Now we can instantiate a clock generator and give it the initial frequency:

.. code-block:: python

    clock = vp.clock_domain.Clock_domain(self, 'clock', frequency=100000000)


Then let's instantiate our real system and connect its clock to the clock generator.
Since we connect the whole system to the clock generator, the same clock will be propagated
to all components in our system:

.. code-block:: python

    soc = Soc(self, 'soc', parser)
    clock.o_CLOCK    (soc.i_CLOCK    ())

Each component is providing methods for getting input ports and connecting output ports, that we
can use to connect our components together.

Now we can declare our real system:

.. code-block:: python

    class Soc(gvsoc.systree.Component):

        def __init__(self, parent, name, parser):
            super().__init__(parent, name)

            # Parse the arguments to get the path to the binary to be loaded
            [args, __] = parser.parse_known_args()

            binary = args.binary

We give it the top parser so that it can get the path of the binary to be simulated, which we
will use later for the loading.

We first instantiate the memory. We give it its size, which is passed as method parameter.
The Python generator of the memory component will declare it as a property, which will make sure
it is passed to the C++ model through its JSON configuration.

.. code-block:: python

    mem = memory.memory.Memory(self, 'mem', size=0x00100000)

Then the interconnect. We bind the interco to the memory with a special binding, since we route
requests to the memory only for a certain range of the memory map.

.. code-block:: python

    ico = interco.router.Router(self, 'ico')
    ico.o_MAP(mem.i_INPUT(), 'mem', base=0x00000000, remove_offset=0x00000000, size=0x00100000)

The range is specified using *base* and *size*. The other argument, *remove_offset* can be used
to remap the base address of the requests, so that they arrive in the memory component with
a local offset.

Now we can add and bind the core. We take a default riscv core:

.. code-block:: python

    host = cpu.iss.riscv.Riscv(self, 'host', isa='rv64imafdc')
    host.o_FETCH     (ico.i_INPUT    ())
    host.o_DATA      (ico.i_INPUT    ())
    host.o_DATA_DEBUG(ico.i_INPUT    ())

We connect everything to the interconnect so that all requests are routed to the memory. The ISS
needs one port for fetching instructions and one for data, in case they need to follow different
paths for timing purpose. We also connect the debug port so that we can also connect GDB.

The next component is not modeling any hardware, but is just here to allow loading the binary to be
simulated.

.. code-block:: python

    loader = utils.loader.loader.ElfLoader(self, 'loader', binary=binary)
    loader.o_OUT     (ico.i_INPUT    ())
    loader.o_START   (host.i_FETCHEN ())
    loader.o_ENTRY   (host.i_ENTRY   ())

We need the loader because GVSOC does not provide any debug feature for loading binaries, as
everything should be simulated using the timing models.

The loader will issue requests to the memory to copy the binary sections. Once done, it will send
the boot address to the core and activate its fetch enable pin so that it can start executing
the binary.

The last component, which is optional, is to put a GDB server so that we can connect GDB to debug
our binary execution.

Now we can compile gvsoc with *make gvsoc*. Since it will execute our script to know which components
should be built, it is possible that we get some Python errors at this point.

Then we can run the simulation with "make all run".

We can activate instruction traces to see what happened: ::

    make all run runner_args="--trace=insn"

In order to connect GDB, we can run the simulation with "make run runner_args=--gdbserver". This will
open an RSP socket and wait for gdb connection which can then be launcher from another
terminal with: ::

    riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb build/test
    (gdb) target remote:12345
    Remote debugging using :12345
    _start () at ../utils/crt0.S:5
    5	    la    x2, stack
    (gdb) break main
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x2c16: file main.c, line 5.
    (gdb) c
    Continuing.

    Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:5
    5	    printf("Hello\n");
    (gdb)
