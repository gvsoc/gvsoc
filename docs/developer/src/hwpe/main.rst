Tutorial - Developing a hardware accelerator
--------------------------------------------
This tutorial is designed to provide a comprehensive, hands-on experience in implementing Hardware Processing Engine (HWPE) and connecting it to the PULP platform using the GVSoC simulation environment. You will learn how to design and implement key components of the HWPE, integrate it with the PULP platform, and develop a software application to test our new integrated system.
