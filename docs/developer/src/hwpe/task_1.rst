1 - Create a new target on the top of pulp-open
................................................
In this section, you will create a new Hardware Target ``pulp-open-hwpe`` which is a replica of the pulp-open consisting of a pulp-cluster. Later we will develop on the ``pulp-open-hwpe`` to add our accelerator. 

Please go through the README to install gvsoc. We suggest the usage of a Python virtual environment like ``venv`` or ``conda`` to install the dependencies.

After the installation is done, setup the source files to add inline comments to help in performing the tasks.

.. admonition:: Task - 1.0 setup the source files  
   :class: task

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd gvsoc
      $ make create_target_task1

Let's create a new gvsoc target ``pulp-open-hwpe`` at ``gvsoc/pulp/`` by copying the pulp-open target.

.. admonition:: Task - 1.1 Create pulp-open-hwpe 
   :class: task

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd gvsoc/pulp
      $ cp pulp-open.py pulp-open-hwpe.py


The new target should work like the pulp-open because it is a copy of the pulp-open. To verify the working, build the gvsoc using TARGET=pulp-open-hwpe and run the hello binary for the same system with this target.

.. admonition:: Verify - 1.1 
   :class: solution
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ make all TARGETS=pulp-open-hwpe
      $ ./install/bin/gvsoc --target=pulp-open-hwpe --binary examples/pulp-open/hello image flash run

You should see the Hello code passing successfully. 

.. admonition:: Task-1.2.1 Familiarize the contents of pulp-open-hwpe.py
   :class: task
   
   Open the newly created ``pulp-open-hwpe.py`` and familiarise yourself. What are your observation?

It is a `GAPY_TARGET`. It relies on the imports from the `pulp/chips/pulp_open` folder. Next we will create a dedicated SoC with a pulp-cluster using the pulp-open template. 

.. code-block:: python
    
    from pulp.chips.pulp_open.pulp_open_board import Pulp_open_board
    import gvsoc.runner as gvsoc

In the next task create a dedicated folder by copying the contents of the pulp_open to pulp_open_hwpe. Then in the following exercises we will change the contents of the pulp_open_hwpe folder.

.. admonition:: Task-1.2.2 Create a replica of pulp_open_board
   :class: task

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd gvsoc/pulp/pulp/chips
      $ mkdir pulp_open_hwpe 
      $ cp pulp_open/* . -r 

Even though we created new pulp_open_hwpe folder, the pulp-open-hwpe.py still points to the pulp_open folder. 
The next part is to change the dependencies to point to the new pulp_open_hwpe files by replacing the correcting path for the model imports. 
 
.. admonition:: Task-1.2.3 Fix the dependencies for pulp-open-hwpe
   :class: task
   
   .. code-block:: python
      
      from pulp.chips.pulp_open_hwpe.pulp_open_board import Pulp_open_board
      import gvsoc.runner as gvsoc

   Similiarly, the references in the following files needs to be modified. Look for the inline hints. 
   
   .. code-block:: text

       gvsoc/pulp/pulp/chips/pulp_open_hwpe
       ├── pulp_open_board.py
       ├── pulp_open.py
       └── cluster.py

After modifications, you can verify that the changes are correct by building GVSoC with the new target
and running the hello application again by executing the following commands:

.. admonition:: Verify - 1.2.3 
   :class: solution
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ make build TARGETS=pulp-open-hwpe
      $ ./install/bin/gvsoc --target=pulp-open-hwpe --binary examples/pulp-open/hello image flash run

The test should pass without any issue. How do you know if your changes are reflected correctly?

.. admonition:: Information
   :class: explanation
   
   GVSoC generates a ``gvsoc_config.json`` file in the ``/gvsoc`` folder when an application is executed. This is a tool-generated file and you can find all the address maps as well as the component connections. Now we can see the changes such as ``cluster_config_file: pulp/chips/pulp-open-hwpe/cluster.json`` in the generated ``gvsoc_config.json`` file.
