# GVSOC

GVSoC is the PULP chips simulator that is natively included in the Pulp SDK and is described and evaluated fully in Bruschi et al. [\[arXiv:2201.08166v1\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08166).

## OS Requirements installation

These instructions were developed using a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).

The following packages needed to be installed:

~~~~~shell
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git doxygen python3-pip libsdl2-dev curl cmake gtkwave libsndfile1-dev rsync autoconf automake texinfo libtool pkg-config libsdl2-ttf-dev
~~~~~


## Python requirements

Additional Python packages are needed and can be installed with the following commands from root folder:

```bash
pip3 install -r core/requirements.txt
pip3 install -r gapy/requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Get submodules and compile GVSoC with this command:

~~~~~shell
make all
~~~~~

It will by default build it for generic targets rv32 and rv64. You can build it for another target with this command:

~~~~~shell
make all TARGETS=pulp-open
~~~~~

On ETH network, please use this command to get the proper version of gcc and cmake:

~~~~~shell
XX=g++-11.2.0 CC=gcc-11.2.0 CMAKE=cmake-3.18.1 make all TARGETS=pulp-open
~~~~~

## Usage

The following example can be launched on pulp-open:

~~~~~shell
./install/bin/gvsoc --target=pulp-open --binary examples/pulp-open/hello --flash-property=boot@flash:rom:boot --flash-property=examples/pulp-open/hello@flash:rom:binary image flash run
